<h1>Beach Photography</h1>


    <main>
      <p>Taking pictures is a form of self expression. I enjoy taking pictures of beaches, particularly beaches in Florida (where I'm from).
These are some other photographers that do beach photography:
Massimo Vitali is an Italian photographer best known for his large-scale color images of beaches.
Amber Mozo is an acclaimed surf photographer and the daughter of legendary surf photographer Jon Mozo.
Gray Malin is a Los Angeles-based fine-art photographer who does aerial beach photography.</p>
